# About

This is my final project of the Full Stack Bootcamp at ISDI Coders and focuses on the development of a comprehensive web application that incorporates authentication functionality, as well as a complete data management system based on the CRUD concept. Additionally, the project also involves the implementation of a robust architecture for handling application states and interconnecting all it's entities.<br>
The chosen theme for this project is a social network that caters to the gaming community, in which users can interact by creating posts, reviewing their favourite games, sharing images, following each other, seeing their games statistics and participating in online chats, among other features. The application is designed to offer a seamless and satisfying user experience and is based on cutting-edge web development technologies.

You can see the Backend repository [clicking here](https://github.com/JoaccoG/players-nation-backend)

# SonarCloud

One of the biggest milestones achieved in this project was the development of high quality code, always prioritising Clean Code with its respective tests over the creation of thousands of features with spaghetti code that, in the long term, result unscalable and end up degenerating the application.<br>
In order to always maintain this good practices, different tools were used, among the most important of which is SonarCloud.<br>
It is in charge of analysing the code in each Pull Request and giving feedback about what can be improved or alert me if something does not meet the Clean Code and good practices standards.<br><br>
Here are the (real-time) badges with the end result of SonarCloud scans:<br><br>

# Demo

You can see a demonstration of the app clicking [here](https://players-nation.netlify.app/).<br>
Please be patient if the first request take a while, the API server is probably _sleeping_ and has a hard time starting up!

# Special thanks

I would like to thank the following people for their help and support during my journey through the ISDI Coders Bootcamp:
